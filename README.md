## How to run
**System Requirement: .NET CLI 5**

Before jump in to run this application, you need to a few setup for Front-end and Back-end:
- Front-end
  - Go to Client folder in SEEMS (this is where we store our Front-end application).
  - Create a `.env.local` file with content exactly like `.env.example` file content.
  - Change `Firebase` and other value (if needed) to your own setting.
- Back-end
  - Go to SEEM folder.
  - Execute `setup.sh` file and do all 3 options to setup.

To start project, you run the below command
```
dotnet run --project .\SEEMS\
```

The command will start the Back-end of the app only.
=> To start the Front-end of the app, you can just access to Backend URL (default is http://localhost:5148).
